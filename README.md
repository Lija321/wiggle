# Wiggle

Wiggle is a GNOME 45+ port/fix for [Jiggle](https://github.com/jeffchannell/jiggle). It magnifies your cursor when the mouse is moved rapidly.

Most features got stripped tho. By now everything is hard-coded.

## Changes

- Support GNOME 45+
- Ditch Tweener in favor of Clutter
- Scale effect only
- No settings available
- Use cursor bitmap directly exported from Adwaita source SVG
